# Always on the road

edit: 31.12.2019

On this day I have map, notes, plans, history.
So you can create account, log in and try basic functions this app.

You add your favorites places where you have been or add places you want to be.
You can add notes, but I still work on it - I would like to every note can be connect with place in your plan, history or road.

See you soon!
